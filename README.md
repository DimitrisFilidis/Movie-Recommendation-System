# Movie-Recommendation-System
The Movie Recommendation System is a collaborative filtering-based recommendation engine built using Python and the Surprise library. This project leverages Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to predict user ratings for movies that a user has not yet rated, thereby generating personalized movie recommendations.
